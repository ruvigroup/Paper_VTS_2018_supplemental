The paper was accepted for pubblication in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (DOI: 10.1109/TITS.2019.2900436).
The pre-print (post-refereeing) of the paper accepted for publication is available at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331167396_A_Bayesian_reference_model_for_visual_time-sharing_behaviour_in_manual_and_automated_naturalistic_driving.

This repository includes additional information for the Bayesian generalized linear mixed effects models defined in the paper:
- in `\data` we stored the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) traces of the posterior distribution of the models' parameters as comma separated value (CSV) files; 
- in `\figures` we stored the plots of the predictive posterior distributions from the models. The figures are described in more details in the document [posterior_predictive_distributions.pdf](https://github.com/ruvigroup/Paper_VTS_2018_supplemental/blob/master/posterior_predictive_distributions.pdf)
