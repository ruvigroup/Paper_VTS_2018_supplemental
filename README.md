The pre-print of the paper is available at https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.16180.91523.

This repository includes additional information for the Bayesian generalized linear mixed effects models defined in the paper:
- in `\data` we stored the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) traces of the posterior distribution of the models' parameters as comma separated value (CSV) files; 
- in `\figures` we stored the plots of the predictive posterior distributions from the models. The figures are described in more details in the document [posterior_predictive_distributions.pdf](https://github.com/ruvigroup/Paper_VTS_2018_supplemental/blob/master/posterior_predictive_distributions.pdf)

The paper has been submitted for publication in a journal. Changes may be made following the review process.
